LD56: Tiny Creatures

# Premise
Player plays the role of a dung beetle in a maze format similar to PacMan.
The beetle is controlled via joystick or other cardinal (non-diagnoal) 
keyboard controls but needs to hold the "fire" button to scoop or roll.

# Map
The map consists of walls, floors, and dung.  Walls are impassible by
the player and ground enemies.  Dug is littered about in regular manner
and is of small size.  The map has a hole in which the beetle pushes dung.
Once in, dung is accumulated for scoring at the level end.

# Enemies
TBD, but probably spiders from the middle of the map.  Other types later
maybe.

# Power-ups
TBD
